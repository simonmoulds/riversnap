Tutorials
=========

riversnap tutorials are based on Jupyter notebooks that are hosted on GitHub. 

| **Hydrography Data**
| For most of our tutorials you will need some data to train and evaluate models. In all of these examples we use the publicly available CAMELS US dataset. :doc:`This tutorial <hydrography-data>` will guide you through the download process of the different dataset pieces and explain how the code expects the local folder structure.

| **Introduction to riversnap**
| If you're new to the riversnap package, :doc:`this tutorial <introduction>` is the place to get started.
